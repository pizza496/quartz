The same goes for campers bugging you/each other about how other people's versions of songs are different. The point of camp is to have fun, not get into arguments with each other about songs. \n\n---\n\n### How this Song Works:\n\nThis song works by cycling through lyrics and chorus. On the first cycle, the first line is shouted out, and then the chorus is said. On the second cycle, the first and second lines are shouted out one after another, and then the chorus is said. This continues through all eight lines.\n\n### Lyrics\n\n1. Thumbs up\n2. Wrists together\n3. Elbows in\n4. Knees in\n5. Toes in\n6. Butt Out\n7. Head Back\n8. Tongue out\n\n##### Chorus:\nAroostisha, Aroostisha, Aroostisha-sha  \nAroostisha, Aroostisha, Aroostisha-sha  \n\n### Hand Gestures/Dances\n\nEach line is some hand gesture or other direction on how campers should contort their bodies. As each line is said, campers should comply with the direction. Campers should not stop complying until after the chorus, that's what makes this song fun.\n\nBecause of how the song is structured, campers will always have their thumbs up before the chorus. During the chorus campers should point thumbs over their shoulders, twice over one shoulder, switch to twice over the other shoulder, and then twice over the first shoulder again, in time with the beat.","lastmodified":"2022-08-29T04:26:05.995942365Z","tags":null},"/songs/Baby-Shark":{"title":"Baby Shark","content":"\n\u003e[!Alert]\n\u003e This is my version.

During the chorus, everyone is singing together all at once.\n\n### Lyrics\n\nMy mom gave me a penny  \nShe said go eat at Denny's  \nBut I didn't eat at Denny's  \n\nInstead I bought some bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum\n\nMy mom gave me a nickel  \nShe said go buy a pickle  \nBut I didn't buy no pickle  \n\nInstead I bought some bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum\n\nMy mom gave me a dime  \nShe said go buy a lime  \nBut I didn't buy no lime  \n\nInstead I bought some bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum\n\nMy mom gave me a quarter  \nShe said go buy some water  \nBut I didn't buy no water  \n\nInstead I bought some bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum\n\nMy mom gave me a dollar  \nShe said go buy a collar  \nBut I didn't buy no collar  \n\nInstead I bought some bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum\n\nMy mom gave me a five  \nShe said go stay alive  \nBut I didn't stay alive  \n\nInstead I **choked** on bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum\n\nMy mom gave me a seven  \nShe said come back from heaven  \nSo I came back from heaven  \n\n**And then I bought more** bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum\n\n### Hand Gestures/Dances\n\nThe only defined hand gestures or body movements in this song come in during the chorus, when everyone is singing together. Starting at bubblegum, everyone claps their hands together over their head, and spins in a circle.\n\nThe only difference is on the second to last chorus when it says choked of bought, people hold their hands up to their throat as if they're choking and spins in a circle.","lastmodified":"2022-08-29T04:26:05.995942365Z","tags":null},"/songs/One-Fat-Hen":{"title":"One Fat Hen","content":"\n\u003e[!Alert]\n\u003e This is my version.

The point of camp is to have fun, not get into arguments with each other about songs. \n\n---\n\n### How the Song Works\n\nLike with the 12 days of Christmas, this song starts with just saying the first line, then the first and second, then first second and third, and so on. This song is also a Repeat After Me song. As an example of how this works: on the fifth run through, the leader would say the first through fifth lines, then the audience would repeat those lines back to the leader.\n\n### Lyrics\n\n1. One fat hen\n2. A couple of ducks\n3. Three baby brown bears\n4. Four rapid running hairs\n5. Five... fat... fidgety... felines\n6. Six simple Simons selling salt in Siam\n7. Seven slimy sailors sniffing snuff\n8. Eight elongated elephants elevating up an extra long escalator\n9. Nine nasty nosed nimbree \"O\"s nibbling on the noses of nine nasty nosed nimbree oughts.\n10. Ten two-ton two-tone tan transcontinental trucks with trailers traveling from Tyler Texas, to Tallassee Tennessee, on twenty-two terrible tires, and two tanks of Texaco True Test on Tuesday the twenty third.\n\n### Music:\n\nThere is no music for this song! This song is sung by just shouting out the lyrics as loud as you can.\n\n### Hand Gestures\n\nHand gestures are much less defined in this song. One good way of at least starting hand gestures is to hold up the number of fingers for the number of things in that line of the song, i.e. one finger for the first line, or six fingers for the sixth line. \n\nUsually when running this song, I hold up fingers for 1-4, I add a clap in between each word for 5, I have nothing for 6, 7, 9 and 10.\n\nFor eight I:\n- mime an elephant tusk on \"elongated elephants\"\n- point up on \"up\"\n- point up and out on \"extra long escalator\"\n\nIf you have your own hand gestures you like to do, then feel free and do them.\n\n### Fun things You can Do With One Fat Hen\n\nIf you're good at talking fast, something you can do to impress/scare campers is to try to sing this song as fast as possible. If you try this at a time when campers aren't required to listen to you, they may start getting a little bit bored in the beginning. Especially if they haven't heard this song before, ask if they want you to skip to ten to finish faster, then go at top speed all the way through the tenth run through.","lastmodified":"2022-08-29T04:26:05.995942365Z","tags":null}}
