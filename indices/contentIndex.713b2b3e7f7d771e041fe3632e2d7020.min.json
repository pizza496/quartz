This is the version that I sing when leading, but if your version is different then sing that one. Either way, be prepared for at least some campers to tell you you're wrong. Some campers wont tell you you're wrong, they'll just sing it how they know it and ignore whatever you're doing.\n\n---\n\n### How the Song Works\n\nLike with the 12 days of Christmas, this song starts with just saying the first line, then the first and second, then first second and third, and so on. This song is also a #Repeat-After-Me song. As an example of how this works: on the fifth run through, the leader would say the first through fifth lines, then the audience would repeat those lines back to the leader.\n\n### Lyrics\n\n1. One fat hen\n2. A couple of ducks\n3. Three baby brown bears\n4. Four rapid running hairs\n5. Five... fat... fidgety... felines\n6. Six simple Simons selling salt in Siam\n7. Seven slimy sailors sniffing snuff\n8. Eight elongated elephants elevating up an extra long escalator\n9. Nine nasty nosed nimbree \"O\"s nibbling on the noses of nine nasty nosed nimbree oughts.\n10. Ten two-ton two-tone tan transcontinental trucks with trailers traveling from Tyler Texas, to Tallassee Tennessee, on twenty-two terrible tires, and two tanks of Texaco True Test on Tuesday the twenty third.\n\n### Music:\n\nThere is no music for this song! This song is sung by just shouting out the lyrics as loud as you can.\n\n### Hand Gestures\n\nHand gestures are much less defined in this song. One good way of at least starting hand gestures is to hold up the number of fingers for the number of things in that line of the song, i.e. one finger for the first line, or six fingers for the sixth line. \n\nUsually when running this song, I hold up fingers for 1-4, I add a clap in between each word for 5, I have nothing for 6, 7, 9 and 10.\n\nFor eight I:\n- mime an elephant tusk on \"elongated elephants\"\n- point up on \"up\"\n- point up and out on \"extra long escalator\"\n\nIf you have your own hand gestures you like to do, then feel free and do them.\n\n---\n\n### Fun things You can Do With One Fat Hen\n\nIf you're good at talking fast, something you can do to impress/scare campers is to try to sing this song as fast as possible. If you try this at a time when campers aren't required to listen to you, they may start getting a little bit bored in the beginning. Especially if they haven't heard this song before, ask if they want you to skip to ten to finish faster, then go at top speed all the way through the tenth run through.","lastmodified":"2022-08-28T20:19:06.333272023Z","tags":null}}
