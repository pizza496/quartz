{"/":{"title":"Some Summer Camp Resources","content":"\n# Yet Another Online Summer Camp Resource Collection\n\nHello! This is a personal project I'm working on in my spare time to write out and upload various summer camp focused resources like songs and games that I've either played/sang while at summer camp myself, or that I've helped lead as a counselor. \n\nIf you have a game or song you want to see in these lists feel free to hit the contact me button at the bottom of every page and send me an email. If you want to help by recording a video of yourself and maybe others singing the song or playing the game or whatever it is you're doing, your help would be very much appreciated.\n\n### [[songs/Song Master List|Songs]]\n\nOne of the resources I'm gathering are songs. On this page is a list of all the songs I currently have. Songs are tagged based aspects like religiosity and song structure. If you see a particular tag on a song and you want to find other songs with that tag then click on it and explore.\n\n### [[games/Games|Games]]\n\nThis is something I'm hoping to get to eventually, but right now I'm focusing on songs.","lastmodified":"2022-09-03T04:54:50.935005204Z","tags":null},"/games/Games":{"title":"Games","content":"\n### Hehe, at this point there aren't any games yet.

I personally like singing my wake up songs as loud as possible right next to my campers if they're not waking up on their own. The tune for this is a vague suggestion at best, and not strictly necessary.

The point of camp is to have fun and having people complaining about someone running some activity differently makes everything less fun.\n\n---\n\n### How this Song Works\n\nSplit everyone up into two groups. This can be like splitting the audience at a campfire, or pairing everyone up and having them link both arms and stand back to back. \n\nGroup one sings the lyrics in bold, group two sings the lyrics in italics.\n\nThe goal is to sing the song as fast as possible. Start slow, then speed up in subsequent repetitions of the song.\n\n### Lyrics\n\n**Allelu allelu allelu alleluia!**\n\n*Praise ye the lord!*\n\n**Allelu allelu allelu alleluia!**\n\n*Praise ye the lord!*\n\n*Praise ye the lord!*\n\n**Alleluia!**\n\n*Praise ye the lord!*\n\n**Alleluia!**\n\n*Praise ye the lord!*\n\n**Alleluia!**\n\n***Praise ye the lord!***\n\n### Dancing\n\nThe part of this song that makes it so fun is the dancing part of it. This guide references two different ways of singing this song, separate groups, or pairs.\n\n##### Separate Groups\n\nFor separate groups, everyone is sitting down.\n\nWhen either group is singing, they're standing as best they're able, and they sit down when they're not.\n\n##### Pairs\n\nFor singing back to back in pairs, each pair links their arms so they're stuck back to back. One person from the pair is in group 1, the other person is in group 2. \n\nWhen group 1 is singing, the pairs all turn so that the group 1 person in each par is facing the person/people leading the song or campfire or whatever is designated as the front. \n\nWhen group 2 is singing, just like with group 1, the pairs turn so that the group 2 member in each pair is facing the front. \n\nDuring the last line, since it is both bold and italicized, groups can turn halfway so that when turning their heads, both members are looking to the front.\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-03T04:54:50.935005204Z","tags":null},"/songs/Announcements-Song":{"title":"Announcements Song","content":"\n\u003e[!Alert]\n\u003e This is my version. Yours may be different, and that's ok. Regardless, bugging me about how mine is wrong because it isn't the exact same as yours doesn't help. The point of camp is to have fun and having people complaining about someone running some activity differently makes everything less fun.\n\n---\n\n### How this Song Works\n\nThis song starts with someone in staff telling the camp that they've got an announcement. Upon hearing about the impending announcement, the camp all starts singing the Announcements Song.\n\nMy suggestion for singing more than one verse, is to split up each announcement with another verse. Whether you pass on the unused extra verses or not is up to you.\n\n### Lyrics\n\nAnnouncements, announcements, announcements  \nWhat a horrible way to die  \nWhat a horrible way to die  \nWhat a horrible way to be talked to death  \nWhat a horrible way to die  \nAnnouncements, announcements, announcements  \n\nAnnouncements, announcements, announcements  \nThey've got another one  \nThey've got another one  \nThey've always got them all the time  \nThey've got another one  \nAnnouncements, announcements, announcements  \n\nAnnouncements, announcements, announcements  \nI'm falling asleep on my feet  \nI'm falling asleep on my feet  \nI'm falling asleep as they bore along  \nI'm falling asleep on my feet  \nAnnouncements, announcements, announcements  \n\nAnnouncements, announcements, announcements  \nWe already sold our cow  \nWe already sold our cow  \nWe have no use for your bull now  \nWe already sold our cow  \nAnnouncements, announcements, announcements  \n\nAnnouncements, announcements, announcements  \nWhen Mary had a little lam  \nThe doctors were surprised  \nBut when old Macdonald had a farm  \nThey couldn't believe their eyes  \nAnnouncements, announcements, announcements  \n\n### Notes\n\nI've only seen the first verse in common use, but I decided to include all the lyrics I had because some of them get really funny. Keep in mind, some of the later verses might not be the most appropriate depending on camper's ages. The first three are all pretty tame, but the fourth and fifth are a little less so.","lastmodified":"2022-09-03T04:54:50.935005204Z","tags":null},"/songs/Aroostisha":{"title":"Aroostisha","content":"\n\u003e[!Alert]\n\u003e This is my version.

The point of camp is to have fun and having people complaining about someone running some activity differently makes everything less fun.\n\n---\n\n### How this Song Works:\n\nThis song works by cycling through lyrics and chorus. On the first cycle, the first line is shouted out, and then the chorus is said. On the second cycle, the first and second lines are shouted out one after another, and then the chorus is said. This continues through all eight lines.\n\n### Lyrics\n\n1. Thumbs up\n2. Wrists together\n3. Elbows in\n4. Knees in\n5. Toes in\n6. Butt Out\n7. Head Back\n8. Tongue out\n\n##### Chorus:\nAroostisha, Aroostisha, Aroostisha-sha  \nAroostisha, Aroostisha, Aroostisha-sha  \n\n### Hand Gestures/Dances\n\nEach line is some hand gesture or other direction on how campers should contort their bodies. As each line is said, campers should comply with the direction. Campers should not stop complying until after the chorus, that's what makes this song fun.\n\nBecause of how the song is structured, campers will always have their thumbs up before the chorus. During the chorus campers should point thumbs over their shoulders, twice over one shoulder, switch to twice over the other shoulder, and then twice over the first shoulder again, in time with the beat.","lastmodified":"2022-09-03T04:54:50.935005204Z","tags":null},"/songs/Baby-Shark":{"title":"Baby Shark","content":"\n\u003e[!Alert]\n\u003e This is my version.

During the chorus, everyone is singing together all at once.\n\n### Lyrics\n\nMy mom gave me a penny  \nShe said go eat at Denny's  \nBut I didn't eat at Denny's  \n\nInstead I bought some bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum\n\nMy mom gave me a nickel  \nShe said go buy a pickle  \nBut I didn't buy no pickle  \n\nInstead I bought some bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum\n\nMy mom gave me a dime  \nShe said go buy a lime  \nBut I didn't buy no lime  \n\nInstead I bought some bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum\n\nMy mom gave me a quarter  \nShe said go buy some water  \nBut I didn't buy no water  \n\nInstead I bought some bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum\n\nMy mom gave me a dollar  \nShe said go buy a collar  \nBut I didn't buy no collar  \n\nInstead I bought some bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum\n\nMy mom gave me a five  \nShe said go stay alive  \nBut I didn't stay alive  \n\nInstead I **choked** on bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum\n\nMy mom gave me a seven  \nShe said come back from heaven  \nSo I came back from heaven  \n\n**And then I bought more** bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum\n\n### Hand Gestures/Dances\n\nThe only defined hand gestures or body movements in this song come in during the chorus, when everyone is singing together. Starting at bubblegum, everyone claps their hands together over their head, and spins in a circle.\n\nThe only difference is on the second to last chorus when it says choked of bought, people hold their hands up to their throat as if they're choking and spins in a circle.","lastmodified":"2022-09-03T04:54:50.935005204Z","tags":null},"/songs/Bean-Song":{"title":"Bean Song","content":"\n\u003e[!Alert]\n\u003e This is my version.

Alternatively, try to convince your campers that it actually is a bean, they've just never heard of it before because it's a very rare type of bean.

In this circle everyone is stomping in time with a set beat.\n\nDuring the ooh, ah, ah, ah, ooh, section the group slowly inches forward into the circle when applicable (you don't move much for dead cockroach). The group stops at one more time now, and then moves backwards until the section is over, and the stomping for the next action continues\n\nFor the boogaloo movement, this is just whatever campers do.

If you have others feel free to share them, this is more just an example for what the verses look like.\n\nAlso: especially for verses like bump another butt, people need to be conscious of whether others might be uncomfortable with the actions.

This song is also a Repeat After Me song. As an example of how this works: on the fifth run through, the leader would say the first through fifth lines, then the audience would repeat those lines back to the leader.\n\n### Lyrics\n\n1. One fat hen\n2. A couple of ducks\n3. Three baby brown bears\n4. Four rapid running hairs\n5. Five... fat... fidgety... felines\n6. Six simple Simons selling salt in Siam\n7. Seven slimy sailors sniffing snuff\n8. Eight elongated elephants elevating up an extra long escalator\n9. Nine nasty nosed nimbree \"O\"s nibbling on the noses of nine nasty nosed nimbree oughts.\n10. Ten two-ton two-tone tan transcontinental trucks with trailers traveling from Tyler Texas, to Tallassee Tennessee, on twenty-two terrible tires, and two tanks of Texaco True Test on Tuesday the twenty third.\n\n### Music:\n\nThere is no music for this song! This song is sung by just shouting out the lyrics as loud as you can.\n\n### Hand Gestures\n\nHand gestures are much less defined in this song. One good way of at least starting hand gestures is to hold up the number of fingers for the number of things in that line of the song, i.e. one finger for the first line, or six fingers for the sixth line. \n\nUsually when running this song, I hold up fingers for 1-4, I add a clap in between each word for 5, I have nothing for 6, 7, 9 and 10.\n\nFor eight I:\n- mime an elephant tusk on \"elongated elephants\"\n- point up on \"up\"\n- point up and out on \"extra long escalator\"\n\nIf you have your own hand gestures you like to do, then feel free and do them.\n\n### Fun Things to Do With This Song\n\nIf you're good at talking fast, something you can do to impress/scare campers is to try to sing this song as fast as possible. If you try this at a time when campers aren't required to listen to you, they may start getting a little bit bored in the beginning. Especially if they haven't heard this song before, ask if they want you to skip to ten to finish faster, then go at top speed all the way through the tenth run through.","lastmodified":"2022-09-03T04:54:50.93900524Z","tags":null},"/songs/Penguin-Song":{"title":"Penguin Song","content":"\n\u003e[!Alert]\n\u003e This is my version.

After shouting the chorus once, cycle through lines of the lyrics followed by the chorus again. Start with just the first line, then on the next cycle add the second line. Continue on like this for the rest of the song.\n\n### Lyrics\n\n1. Right flipper  \n2. Left flipper  \n3. Right leg  \n4. Left leg  \n5. Butt out  \n6. Chin up \n7. Walk about\n8.

If a camper tries to jump make sure they're safe.

In most of my time as a camper, this song has been done around campfires. I personally find hearing the echo coming back out of the night is a really cool experience that makes camp much more fun.\n\nThe lyrics are repeated 3 times. The first time through, everyone should be whispering. The second run through, everyone should be at regular speaking volume or maybe a little bit louder. On the third run through everyone should be shouting at the top of their lungs. \n\nThis is the really important bit: on the third run through of the lyrics everyone should cut the song off at deep. This song is good for a returning activity because the first couple times campers will almost always have some people accidentally saying blue when everyone else is silent. When that happens accept it and move on. You can repeat the song again right after or hold off on it for another night.\n\n### Lyrics\n\nRock in the cradle\nRock in the cradle\nRock in the cradle in the deep blue sea","lastmodified":"2022-09-03T04:54:50.93900524Z","tags":null},"/songs/Song-Master-List":{"title":"Songs","content":"\nBelow you can find a list of what is hopefully all the songs I've written up so far in alphabetical order.
