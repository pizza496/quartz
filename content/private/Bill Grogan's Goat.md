### Lyrics

Bill Grogan's Goat
Was feeling fine
Ate three red shirts
Right off the line

Bill took a stick
Gave him a whack
And tied him to
The railroad Track

The whistle blew
The train grew nye
Bill Grogan's Goat
Was doomed to die

He gave three groans
Of awful pain
Coughed up the shirts
And flagged the train

But one of those shirts
Got caught in his throat
And that was the end
Of Bill Grogan's Goat

The point of camp is to have fun and having people complaining about someone running some activity differently makes everything less fun.
