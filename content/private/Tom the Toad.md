### Lyrics

Oh Tom the toad, oh Tom the toad  
Why did you go out on the road  

You once were green, but now you're red
You had a head, but now you're dead

Oh Tom the toad oh Tom the toad
Why did you go out on the road

> This is my version. Yours may be different, and that's ok. Regardless, bugging me about how mine is wrong because it isn't the exact same as yours doesn't help. The point of camp is to have fun and having people complaining about someone running some activity differently makes everything less fun.
