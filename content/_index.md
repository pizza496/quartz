# Yet Another Online Summer Camp Resource Collection

Hello! This is a personal project I'm working on in my spare time to write out and upload various summer camp focused resources like songs and games that I've either played/sang while at summer camp myself, or that I've helped lead as a counselor. 

If you have a game or song you want to see in these lists feel free to hit the contact me button at the bottom of every page and send me an email. If you want to help by recording a video of yourself and maybe others singing the song or playing the game or whatever it is you're doing, your help would be very much appreciated.

### [[songs/Song Master List|Songs]]

One of the resources I'm gathering are songs. On this page is a list of all the songs I currently have. Songs are tagged based aspects like religiosity and song structure. If you see a particular tag on a song and you want to find other songs with that tag then click on it and explore.

### [[games/Games|Games]]

This is something I'm hoping to get to eventually, but right now I'm focusing on songs.
