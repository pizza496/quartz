>[!Alert]
> This is my version. Yours may be different, and that's ok. Regardless, bugging me about how mine is wrong because it isn't the exact same as yours doesn't help. The point of camp is to have fun and having people complaining about someone running some activity differently makes everything less fun.

### Lyrics

I'm alive, awake, alert, enthusiastic!  
I'm alive, awake, alert, enthusiastic!  
I'm alive, awake, alert,  
I'm alert, awake, alive,  
I'm alive, awake, alert, enthusiastic!  

### Hand Gestures

Clap twice whenever after saying enthusiastic.


### Notes

This is a really good wake up song. I personally like singing my wake up songs as loud as possible right next to my campers if they're not waking up on their own. The tune for this is a vague suggestion at best, and not strictly necessary.
