> This is my version. Yours may be different, and that's ok. Regardless, bugging me about how mine is wrong because it isn't the exact same as yours doesn't help. The point of camp is to have fun and having people complaining about someone running some activity differently makes everything less fun.

### How This Song Works

This song is specifically not a large group participation song. There are people singing, usually staff, and the people watching, usually the campers.

Everyone singing starts standing in a line with their backs to the audience. The first person, usually one of the people on an end, turns around and sings their line, filling in the blanks with the correct pieces.

### Lyrics

I'm glad that I'm \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
There's no place I'd rather be  
'Cause if I weren't \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
A [Character] I would be.  
[Character's Line]
