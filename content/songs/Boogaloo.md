>[!Alert]
> This is my version. Yours may be different, and that's ok. Regardless, bugging me about how mine is wrong because it isn't the exact same as yours doesn't help. The point of camp is to have fun and having people complaining about someone running some activity differently makes everything less fun.

### How This Song Works

Bold text are lines called out by the person leading this song, and italics are the group's responses. Regular text is everyone together. Replace underlined sections with other movements to keep the song going.

### Lyrics

**Let me see your <u>boogaloo</u>!**

*What's that you say?*

**I said let me see your <u>boogaloo</u>!**

*What's that you say?*

**I said let me see your <u>boogaloo</u>!**

*What's that you say?*

I said ooh, ah, ah, ah ooh, ah, ah, ah, ooh, ah, ah, ah, ooh

One more time now!

Ooh, ah, ah, ah ooh, ah, ah, ah, ooh, ah, ah, ah, ooh

### Hand Gestures/Dances

During the call and response section, the general group should be arranged in a circle ish shape around the leader(s). In this circle everyone is stomping in time with a set beat.

During the ooh, ah, ah, ah, ooh, section the group slowly inches forward into the circle when applicable (you don't move much for dead cockroach). The group stops at one more time now, and then moves backwards until the section is over, and the stomping for the next action continues

For the boogaloo movement, this is just whatever campers do. If you want to give instructions for this, boogaloo is just whatever fun little dance they come up with.
