> This is my version. Yours may be different, and that's ok. Regardless, bugging me about how mine is wrong because it isn't the exact same as yours doesn't help. The point of camp is to have fun and having people complaining about someone running some activity differently makes everything less fun.

### How This Song Works

This section is really important, because when done well this song can cause a wonderful echo for campers to hear. In most of my time as a camper, this song has been done around campfires. I personally find hearing the echo coming back out of the night is a really cool experience that makes camp much more fun.

The lyrics are repeated 3 times. The first time through, everyone should be whispering. The second run through, everyone should be at regular speaking volume or maybe a little bit louder. On the third run through everyone should be shouting at the top of their lungs. 

This is the really important bit: on the third run through of the lyrics everyone should cut the song off at deep. This song is good for a returning activity because the first couple times campers will almost always have some people accidentally saying blue when everyone else is silent. When that happens accept it and move on. You can repeat the song again right after or hold off on it for another night.

Rock in the cradle
Rock in the cradle
Rock in the cradle in the deep blue sea
