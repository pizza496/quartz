### How This Song Works

For the most part this is a repeat after me song, but there is some deviation is during the chorus, which are the lines talking about buying/choking on bubblegum. During the chorus, everyone is singing together all at once.

### Lyrics

My mom gave me a penny  
She said go eat at Denny's  
But I didn't eat at Denny's  

Instead I bought some bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum

My mom gave me a nickel  
She said go buy a pickle  
But I didn't buy no pickle  

Instead I bought some bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum

My mom gave me a dime  
She said go buy a lime  
But I didn't buy no lime  

Instead I bought some bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum

My mom gave me a quarter  
She said go buy some water  
But I didn't buy no water  

Instead I bought some bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum

My mom gave me a dollar  
She said go buy a collar  
But I didn't buy no collar  

Instead I bought some bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum

My mom gave me a five  
She said go stay alive  
But I didn't stay alive  

Instead I **choked** on bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum

My mom gave me a seven  
She said come back from heaven  
So I came back from heaven  

**And then I bought more** bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum, bazooka-zooka bubblegum

### Hand Gestures/Dances

The only defined hand gestures or body movements in this song come in during the chorus, when everyone is singing together. Starting at bubblegum, everyone claps their hands together over their head, and spins in a circle.

The only difference is on the second to last chorus when it says choked of bought, people hold their hands up to their throat as if they're choking and spins in a circle.

> This is my version. Yours may be different, and that's ok. Regardless, bugging me about how mine is wrong because it isn't the exact same as yours doesn't help. The point of camp is to have fun and having people complaining about someone running some activity differently makes everything less fun.
