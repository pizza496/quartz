### How This Song Works

After singing this song once through, you can repeat, substituting different beans in for lima.

### Lyrics

My dog Lima likes to roam  
One day Lima left their home  
They came back all squeaky clean  
Where oh where has Lima bean
Lima bean, Lima bean
Where oh where has Lima bean
Lima bean, Lima bean
Where oh where has Lima bean

### Some Example Beans

Pinto
Coffee
Refried

Beans work better if the name is 2 syllables, but creative phrasing can overcome this problem.

### Ways to Mess With Your Campers

After going through several beans, replace Lima with something that is definitely not a bean, and when asked, point out that the song isn't about beans, it's about your dogs. Alternatively, try to convince your campers that it actually is a bean, they've just never heard of it before because it's a very rare type of bean.

> This is my version. Yours may be different, and that's ok. Regardless, bugging me about how mine is wrong because it isn't the exact same as yours doesn't help. The point of camp is to have fun and having people complaining about someone running some activity differently makes everything less fun.
