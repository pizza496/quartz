>[!Alert]
> This is my version. Yours may be different, and that's ok. Regardless, bugging me about how mine is wrong because it isn't the exact same as yours doesn't help. The point of camp is to have fun and having people complaining about someone running some activity differently makes everything less fun.

### How the Song Works

Like with the 12 days of Christmas, this song starts with just saying the first line, then the first and second, then first second and third, and so on. This song is also a Repeat After Me song. As an example of how this works: on the fifth run through, the leader would say the first through fifth lines, then the audience would repeat those lines back to the leader.

### Lyrics

1. One fat hen
2. A couple of ducks
3. Three baby brown bears
4. Four rapid running hairs
5. Five... fat... fidgety... felines
6. Six simple Simons selling salt in Siam
7. Seven slimy sailors sniffing snuff
8. Eight elongated elephants elevating up an extra long escalator
9. Nine nasty nosed nimbree "O"s nibbling on the noses of nine nasty nosed nimbree oughts.
10. Ten two-ton two-tone tan transcontinental trucks with trailers traveling from Tyler Texas, to Tallassee Tennessee, on twenty-two terrible tires, and two tanks of Texaco True Test on Tuesday the twenty third.

### Music:

There is no music for this song! This song is sung by just shouting out the lyrics as loud as you can.

### Hand Gestures

Hand gestures are much less defined in this song. One good way of at least starting hand gestures is to hold up the number of fingers for the number of things in that line of the song, i.e. one finger for the first line, or six fingers for the sixth line. 

Usually when running this song, I hold up fingers for 1-4, I add a clap in between each word for 5, I have nothing for 6, 7, 9 and 10.

For eight I:
- mime an elephant tusk on "elongated elephants"
- point up on "up"
- point up and out on "extra long escalator"

If you have your own hand gestures you like to do, then feel free and do them.

### Fun Things to Do With This Song

If you're good at talking fast, something you can do to impress/scare campers is to try to sing this song as fast as possible. If you try this at a time when campers aren't required to listen to you, they may start getting a little bit bored in the beginning. Especially if they haven't heard this song before, ask if they want you to skip to ten to finish faster, then go at top speed all the way through the tenth run through.
