> This is my version. Yours may be different, and that's ok. Regardless, bugging me about how mine is wrong because it isn't the exact same as yours doesn't help. The point of camp is to have fun and having people complaining about someone running some activity differently makes everything less fun.

### How This Song Works

Sing the lyrics, repeat after because. Since this is the song that never ends, you just don't stop singing it.

### Lyrics

This is the song that never ends,  
It just goes on and on my friend!  
Some people started singing it  
Not knowing what it was  
And we'll continue singing it forever just because...
