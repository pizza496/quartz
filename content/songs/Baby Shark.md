# Baby Shark

>[!Alert]
> This is my version. Yours may be different, and that's ok. Regardless, bugging me about how mine is wrong because it isn't the exact same as yours doesn't help. The same goes for campers bugging you/each other about how other people's versions of songs are different. The point of camp is to have fun, not get into arguments with each other about songs.
