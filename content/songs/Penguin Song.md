>[!Alert]
> This is my version. Yours may be different, and that's ok. Regardless, bugging me about how mine is wrong because it isn't the exact same as yours doesn't help. The point of camp is to have fun and having people complaining about someone running some activity differently makes everything less fun.

### How This Song Works

Start with the chorus. After shouting the chorus once, cycle through lines of the lyrics followed by the chorus again. Start with just the first line, then on the next cycle add the second line. Continue on like this for the rest of the song.

### Lyrics

1. Right flipper  
2. Left flipper  
3. Right leg  
4. Left leg  
5. Butt out  
6. Chin up 
7. Walk about
8. Tongue out

##### Chorus

If you want to be a penguin  
Then a penguin you shall be  
If you want to be a penguin  
Do it just like me!  
Penguin attention! Penguin salute!

### Notes

Once right leg and left leg are both called, it is easier to alternate right and left leg so you aren't jumping. If a camper tries to jump make sure they're safe.
