### How This Song Works

The person(s) leading the song shout out one line and wait for the group to repeat it, this continues on throughout the entire song.

The blank at the end of the song is to fill in with other styles. These styles can either mean altered lyrics or a change to how people are speaking.

### Lyrics

### Fun Things to Do With This Song

This song is good for camper engagement. Especially if campers like this song, they will have their favorite styles. This is a good opportunity to let them lead part of a song, especially if you need some time to come up with other versions

> This is my version. Yours may be different, and that's ok. Regardless, bugging me about how mine is wrong because it isn't the exact same as yours doesn't help. The point of camp is to have fun and having people complaining about someone running some activity differently makes everything less fun.
