>[!Alert]
> This is my version. Yours may be different, and that's ok. Regardless, bugging me about how mine is wrong because it isn't the exact same as yours doesn't help. The same goes for campers bugging you/each other about how other people's versions of songs are different. The point of camp is to have fun, not get into arguments with each other about songs.

### How this Song Works:

This song works by cycling through lyrics and chorus. On the first cycle, the first line is shouted out, and then the chorus is said. On the second cycle, the first and second lines are shouted out one after another, and then the chorus is said. This continues through all eight lines.

### Lyrics

1. Thumbs up
2. Wrists together
3. Elbows in
4. Knees in
5. Toes in
6. Butt Out
7. Head Back
8. Tongue out

##### Chorus:
Aroostisha, Aroostisha, Aroostisha-sha  
Aroostisha, Aroostisha, Aroostisha-sha  

### Hand Gestures/Dances

Each line is some hand gesture or other direction on how campers should contort their bodies. As each line is said, campers should comply with the direction. Campers should not stop complying until after the chorus, that's what makes this song fun.

Because of how the song is structured, campers will always have their thumbs up before the chorus. During the chorus campers should point thumbs over their shoulders, twice over one shoulder, switch to twice over the other shoulder, and then twice over the first shoulder again, in time with the beat.
