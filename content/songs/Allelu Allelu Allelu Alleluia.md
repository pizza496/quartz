### How this Song Works

Split everyone up into two groups. This can be like splitting the audience at a campfire, or pairing everyone up and having them link both arms and stand back to back. 

Group one sings the lyrics in bold, group two sings the lyrics in italics.

The goal is to sing the song as fast as possible. Start slow, then speed up in subsequent repetitions of the song.

### Lyrics

**Allelu allelu allelu alleluia!**

*Praise ye the lord!*

**Allelu allelu allelu alleluia!**

*Praise ye the lord!*

*Praise ye the lord!*

**Alleluia!**

*Praise ye the lord!*

**Alleluia!**

*Praise ye the lord!*

**Alleluia!**

***Praise ye the lord!***

### Dancing

The part of this song that makes it so fun is the dancing part of it. This guide references two different ways of singing this song, separate groups, or pairs.

##### Separate Groups

For separate groups, everyone is sitting down.

When either group is singing, they're standing as best they're able, and they sit down when they're not.

##### Pairs

For singing back to back in pairs, each pair links their arms so they're stuck back to back. One person from the pair is in group 1, the other person is in group 2. 

When group 1 is singing, the pairs all turn so that the group 1 person in each par is facing the person/people leading the song or campfire or whatever is designated as the front. 

When group 2 is singing, just like with group 1, the pairs turn so that the group 2 member in each pair is facing the front. 

During the last line, since it is both bold and italicized, groups can turn halfway so that when turning their heads, both members are looking to the front.

> This is my version. Yours may be different, and that's ok. Regardless, bugging me about how mine is wrong because it isn't the exact same as yours doesn't help. The point of camp is to have fun and having people complaining about someone running some activity differently makes everything less fun.
