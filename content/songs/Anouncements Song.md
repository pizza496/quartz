>[!Alert]
> This is my version. Yours may be different, and that's ok. Regardless, bugging me about how mine is wrong because it isn't the exact same as yours doesn't help. The point of camp is to have fun and having people complaining about someone running some activity differently makes everything less fun.

### How this Song Works

This song starts with someone in staff telling the camp that they've got an announcement. Upon hearing about the impending announcement, the camp all starts singing the Announcements Song.

My suggestion for singing more than one verse, is to split up each announcement with another verse. Whether you pass on the unused extra verses or not is up to you.

### Lyrics

Announcements, announcements, announcements  
What a horrible way to die  
What a horrible way to die  
What a horrible way to be talked to death  
What a horrible way to die  
Announcements, announcements, announcements  

Announcements, announcements, announcements  
They've got another one  
They've got another one  
They've always got them all the time  
They've got another one  
Announcements, announcements, announcements  

Announcements, announcements, announcements  
I'm falling asleep on my feet  
I'm falling asleep on my feet  
I'm falling asleep as they bore along  
I'm falling asleep on my feet  
Announcements, announcements, announcements  

Announcements, announcements, announcements  
We already sold our cow  
We already sold our cow  
We have no use for your bull now  
We already sold our cow  
Announcements, announcements, announcements  

Announcements, announcements, announcements  
When Mary had a little lam  
The doctors were surprised  
But when old Macdonald had a farm  
They couldn't believe their eyes  
Announcements, announcements, announcements  

### Notes

I've only seen the first verse in common use, but I decided to include all the lyrics I had because some of them get really funny. Keep in mind, some of the later verses might not be the most appropriate depending on camper's ages. The first three are all pretty tame, but the fourth and fifth are a little less so.
