### Lyrics

How could anyone ever tell you  
You are anything less than beautiful  
How could anyone ever tell you  
You are less than whole  
How could anyone fail to notice  
That your loving is a miracle  
How deeply you're connected to my soul  

### Notes

In my time at camp this has usually been one of the songs sung right before going to bed, or before leaving camp at the end of the week, as it's a very low energy song.

Campers who've heard this song before and have sung it at camp will probably add an echo after "to my soul."

>[!Alert]
> This is my version. Yours may be different, and that's ok. Regardless, bugging me about how mine is wrong because it isn't the exact same as yours doesn't help. The point of camp is to have fun and having people complaining about someone running some activity differently makes everything less fun.
