>[!Alert]
> This is my version. Yours may be different, and that's ok. Regardless, bugging me about how mine is wrong because it isn't the exact same as yours doesn't help. The point of camp is to have fun and having people complaining about someone running some activity differently makes everything less fun.

### How This Song Works

Regular repeat after me song, except the last two lines work better when done in unison. You can have the second to last line be back and forth with campers repeating each word right after you, but unison works fine.

### Lyrics

You can't ride in my little red wagon  
The wheels are broken and the axel's saggin'  
Same, song, same, verse  
A little bit louder and a little bit worse
